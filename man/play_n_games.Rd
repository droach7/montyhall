\title{Looping the game.}
\usage{
play_n_games(n = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{Requires}{one specified argument, the number of desired iterations in the loop.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list of wins and losses that can be bound into a proportions
table with the row proportions for each strategy in the game.
}
\description{
'play_n_games' loops the play_game function through a specified number of iterations.
}
\details{
Looping the game many times increases the statistical power and makes it more likely
that the simulated statistics will be closer to the actual theoretical values.
The loop must include a collector vector, an iterator, and a binding step.
}
\examples{
play_n_games
results.df <- dplyr::bind_rows( results.list ) # binding step
table( results.df ) \%>\%
prop.table( margin=1 ) \%>\%  # row proportions
round( 2 ) \%>\%
print()
return( results.df )
}
